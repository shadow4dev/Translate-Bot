# Translation Bot 

## About the Project
All rights reserved to **CodersHub**.  
This project was developed by **Shadow**, a programmer from the CodersHub team.  

### How It Works
This project enables a bot to translate messages from Arabic to English automatically. It uses the [`@iamtraction/google-translate`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@iamtraction/google-translate) library to connect to the Google Translate API. Once a message is sent in Arabic, the bot detects it, translates it, and sends the English translation in less than a second.

### Project Video Explanation
A full explanation of the project is available on the developer's YouTube channel (**Shadow**):  
[Watch the video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-0HRP9ghQQ&t=181s).

### Free Project
This project is available for free, providing an efficient solution for translation, and is powered by trusted resources.
